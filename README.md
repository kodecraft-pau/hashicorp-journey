## Introduction

Migrating our entire infrastructure was a huge project, and after careful consideration, we decided to switch to the HashiCorp suite. In this blog, I want to share our journey, the challenges we faced, the solutions we found, and what the whole experience was like using HashiCorp tools to optimize our infrastructure.

The HashiCorp suite offers a fantastic set of tools for managing infrastructure. With Terraform for infrastructure as code, Nomad for workload orchestration, Vault for secrets management, and Consul for service discovery, these tools have significantly improved how we manage, scale, and secure our infrastructure. Our goals were not only to stay on the competitive edge but also to lower the costs of our infrastructure without sacrificing quality.

## Initial Setup and Planning

Before diving into the migration, we thoroughly assessed our existing infrastructure. We looked at our current setup, identified key pain points, and set clear objectives for what we wanted to achieve with the migration. Our main goals were to improve scalability, enhance security, and streamline our deployment processes.

After assessing our needs, we chose specific HashiCorp tools that aligned with our objectives. We picked Terraform for managing our infrastructure as code, Nomad for orchestrating our workloads, Vault for secure secrets management, and Consul for service discovery and configuration. These tools fit our requirements perfectly and integrated seamlessly with our existing systems.

We began by setting up the foundational components of our new infrastructure. This included configuring our environment, setting up necessary resources, and making sure all prerequisites were met. To test the setup faster, I created a Vagrant file configuration. Since this was done locally, it eliminated the need to create instances on AWS, thus avoiding unnecessary costs. This initial setup phase was crucial as it laid the groundwork for the entire migration process.

## Migration Process

The migration process involved several stages, starting with the initial setup, followed by incremental changes to ensure a smooth transition.

Initially, we planned the migration together with other senior members of our team. However, we soon realized that each of these tools is highly interdependent. Given this complexity, it became clear that studying and implementing the tools together rather than separately would be more effective. As a result, I took the lead on the migration process to ensure a cohesive and integrated approach. We moved components gradually, verified their functionality, and made adjustments as needed. Starting with less critical components allowed us to test the waters and gradually move to more essential parts of our infrastructure.

Terraform played a pivotal role in our migration. By defining our infrastructure as code, we could version control our configurations and make infrastructure changes reproducible and predictable. We wrote Terraform configuration files for each resource and tested them first in a development environment. Once we were confident in the setup, we deployed and tested the same configuration in our staging environment, ensuring that everything worked seamlessly before finally applying them to our production environment. This approach improved our infrastructure management and gave us greater visibility and control over our resources.

Using Nomad for workload orchestration was another significant step in our migration journey. We defined our jobs and workloads in Nomad's job specification files, which allowed us to manage and schedule our applications more efficiently. The flexibility and simplicity of Nomad made it easier to deploy and manage our applications, leading to improved operational efficiency and reduced downtime.

Vault's role in managing secrets and sensitive data cannot be overstated. We integrated Vault to securely store and access secrets, ensuring that our sensitive information was protected. The setup involved configuring Vault policies, setting up authentication methods, and securely storing our secrets. This enhanced our security posture and provided peace of mind knowing that our secrets were managed safely.

Consul was instrumental in service discovery and configuration management. By integrating Consul into our infrastructure, we could dynamically discover and configure services, ensuring that our applications were always aware of the current state of the system. This integration improved our system's resilience and reduced the complexity of managing configurations across multiple environments.

## Challenges and Solutions

During the migration, we faced several challenges, like understanding the new tools, dealing with integration issues, and managing the learning curve. For example, the initial setup of Terraform configurations required a deep understanding of our existing infrastructure, which took considerable time and effort.

To overcome these challenges, I subscribed to Udemy and took every available course on HashiCorp tools that I needed to understand them better. This investment in learning was crucial for gaining a deeper understanding of the tools. We also spent time exploring the documentation provided by HashiCorp and sought help from the community. Engaging in trial-and-error to find the best solutions was part of the process. By documenting our processes and solutions, we created a valuable resource for future reference. Additionally, setting up a sandbox environment for testing and experimentation helped us understand the tools better before applying changes to our production environment.

## Integration and Testing

Integrating the new infrastructure with our continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline is still in progress. We are creating GitHub Actions as our CI/CD tool. This will ensure that our deployment processes remain efficient and automated, reducing manual intervention and the risk of errors. Once implemented, this will allow us to deploy changes more frequently and reliably.

Extensive testing and validation were crucial to ensure the new infrastructure performed as expected. We implemented rigorous testing protocols to identify and address any issues, ensuring a smooth transition and reliable performance. This included functional testing, performance testing, and security testing to ensure our new setup met all our requirements and standards.

## Deployment and Monitoring

Deploying the migrated infrastructure involved careful planning to minimize downtime and ensure a seamless transition. We implemented strategies that allowed us to deploy changes incrementally, reducing the impact on our operations. Blue-green deployments and canary releases were some of the techniques we used to ensure our deployments were smooth and without significant disruptions.

Our observability setup is still in progress, but we plan to use tools like Grafana, Loki, Prometheus, Tempo, and more to monitor our applications, logs, and other metrics. These tools will help us ensure the continued performance and reliability of our infrastructure by providing comprehensive monitoring solutions to track the health of our systems and promptly address any issues that arise.

## Lessons Learned and Best Practices

Throughout the migration process, we learned several valuable lessons, such as the importance of thorough planning, the value of incremental changes, and the need for comprehensive testing and monitoring. We also realized the importance of continuous learning and adapting to new tools and technologies to stay ahead.

Based on our experience, we recommend other organizations considering a similar migration to invest in thorough planning, engage with the community for support, and document their processes meticulously. Additionally, setting up a dedicated team to manage the migration and ensuring that they have the necessary resources and training can significantly ease the process.

## Conclusion

Migrating to the HashiCorp suite has been a transformative experience for our organization. The new tools have enhanced our infrastructure management capabilities, improved our security posture, and streamlined our deployment processes. While the journey was not without its challenges, the benefits we have gained far outweigh the difficulties we faced. We are now better equipped to handle our infrastructure needs and are confident in our ability to scale and adapt to future challenges. This migration not only keeps us on the competitive edge but also helps us lower the costs of our infrastructure without sacrificing its quality. Even I did not expect the cost savings to be this significant. We saved triple or even quadruple times more than we initially anticipated. Without a doubt, Zeet is one of a kind, but we also need to run our infrastructure in the most efficient way in terms of costs.

I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to Karl for supporting me throughout this journey. His guidance was invaluable, especially during times when I felt like I was walking down the wrong path. His encouragement and insights helped keep me on track and ensured the success of this migration.

### Future Plans

Given this opportunity and experience, I'm planning to take it to the next level by continuing to learn about HashiCorp tools and pursuing certifications if possible. This will help solidify my knowledge and further enhance our infrastructure management capabilities.
